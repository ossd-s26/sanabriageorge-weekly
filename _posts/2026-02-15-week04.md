## Git Practice
I have used git extensively from Computer Operations so I do have a good amount of experience on it. However, I was able to learn more about it specifically on new commands. I was not aware about git cat-file and the different variations on it. Ultimately, it was interesting to learn more about something I thought I knew a lot about.

## Project Evaluations
After looking through many of the different projects it is worth noting how community based they are. Many of these porjects have such a large community that they are still getting update till this day. All of the projects make it super easy to learn how to contribute which is motivating in a sense because it shows that they are open to changes. I think I am more excited about being able to contribute to a large project and seeing it live. Being apart of the community also seems super fun. Howver, I think one of the biggest challanges is waiting to receive a response or accepting your change. Looking at the issues tracker it appears that there are times when someones edit or solution takes months to be approved since going back and forth. This issue appears to be a common thing in these projects and I believe to avoid it, a smaller issue with an easy fix must be chosen.
