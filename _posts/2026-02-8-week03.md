## Starting Off Project 1
I had the privilege to join two other peers in collaborating on the first open source project assigned. We started off on learning on how to create our first google chrome extension. This one got me a little stump however, my team was able to pull me out the mud. We had good discussions when it came to lookign over exisiting extensions. One issue that arose was deciding on an extension of our own to create since we had many ideas. One of these ideas included an extension that would allow users to see where their products come from specifically. We looked at ane extension that allowed users to play videos on the background while being able to multitask. Overall, although this is only the beginning of our project I believe we will succeed in creating something interesting. This project showed me the amount of team work and collaboration required on creating one project.
